PRIVACY POLICY

Offi requests the following permissions:

• Full network access, because Offi needs to query information services
  for departures and disruptions (live data).
• Location, so Offi can show nearby stations and navigate you from your
  current location. The app-widget needs the location permission all the
  time, whereas the app itself only needs it while using Offi.
• Contacts, so Offi can route you to or from your contacts.

Other than that, Offi will not collect or use your private data.

There are no ads or tracking.
