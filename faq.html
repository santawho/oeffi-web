	<dt>I keep posting comments to the Android market, but I don't get
	any reply.</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This is because Google does not allow replies to market
	comments. I cannot even post comments myself, as the publisher.</p>
	<p>If you have a suggestion, a question or some other form of
	feedback that asks for a reply, consider <a
		href="mailto:oeffi@schildbach.de">e-mailing me</a>. Better yet, read
	through this FAQ first. Some frequent issues are already covered here.</p>
	<p>You are still invited to post market comments (and ratings).
	However, consider this as a way to just tell your opinion to other
	(potential) users.</p>

	<dt>Öffi has got three launcher icons. Why is this?</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Öffi consists of three mostly independant parts:
	<ul>
		<li>Stations: Which stations are nearby and will I catch the
		bus/train?
		<li>Directions: How do I get from A to B?
		<li>Plans: I want to navigate myself.
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Some of you regularly use Stations and some of you normally use
	Directions. I received some complaints that you always had to go
	through Stations in order to get to Directions. And, to be honest, this
	is not healthy for the phones resources as well. Thus, I introduced
	icons to directly launch into each part.</p>
	<p>You don't have to <i>use</i> all icons though. It is still
	possible to go though one of the other application parts if you like
	to, by using the options menu.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>But I don't like my desktop cluttered with three icons.</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Note that you only need to put the needed/wanted icon(s) on your
	desktop. Leave the other icons alone and never see them again. If you
	prefer to directly launch application parts without having three icons
	on your desktop, put them into a folder! If you need to switch to
	another application part only now and then, feel free to use the
	options menu.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Using my mobile data connection, I often get errors or 'no
	information available'. Using WLAN, everything works fine. What's going
	on?</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Most likely, this is due to your network provider not conforming
	to net neutrality. In order to save bandwidth, some providers drop
	information from the conversation they consider unneeded. They also add
	other information they think at least wouldn't harm. Both of these are
	false assumptions. The forums are full of problem descriptions that can
	be attributed to this behaviour.</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>T-Mobile Germany: Their 'feature' is called Speed Manager and
		can be disabled via a <a href="http://speedmanager.t-mobile.de/">web
		interface</a>. I strongly advise you to do so, as this issue affects other
		applications as well.</li>
		<li>Vodafone D2: Affected, but I don't know how to disable. Would
		you email back if you find out? Otherwise, I'd recommend switching
		your contract over to o2 or e-plus.</li>
		<li>o2 Germany and e-plus: Not affected, currently.</li>
	</ul>
