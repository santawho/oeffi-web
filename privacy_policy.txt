Requested permissions:

• Full network access, because Offi needs to query information services
  for departures and disruptions.
• Location, so Offi can show nearby stations and navigate you from your
  current location.
• Contacts/Calendar, so Offi can route you to your contacts or location
  from a calendar event, store a connection in your calendar or e-mail it
  to your friends.

Other than that, Offi will not use your private data.
