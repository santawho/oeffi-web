	<dt>Öffi has got three launcher icons. Why is this?</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Öffi consists of three nearly independant parts:
	<ul>
		<li>Stations: Which stations are nearby and when can I go from
		there?
		<li>Directions: How do I get from A to B?
		<li>Plans: I want to navigate myself.
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Some of you regularly use Stations and some of you normally use
	Directions. I received some complaints that you always had to go
	through Stations in order to get to Directions. And, to be honest, this
	is not healthy for the phones resources as well. Thus, I introduced
	icons to directly launch into each part.</p>
	<p>You don't have to <i>use</i> all icons though, it is still
	possible to go though one of the other application parts by using the
	options menu.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>But I don't like seeing three icons all the time.</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>You only need to put the needed/wanted icon(s) on your desktop.
	Leave the other icons alone and never see them again. If you need to
	switch to another application part only sometimes, feel free to use the
	options menu.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Using my mobile data connection, I often get errors or 'no
	information available'. Using WLAN, everything works fine. What's going
	on?</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Most likely, this is due to your network provider not conforming
	to net neutrality. In order to save bandwidth, some providers drop
	information from the conversation they consider unneeded. They also add
	other information they think at least wouldn't harm. Both of these are
	false assumptions. The forums are full of problem descriptions that can
	be attributed to this behaviour.</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>T-Mobile Germany: Their 'feature' is called Speed Manager and
		can be disabled via the customer web interface.</li>
		<li>Vodafone D2: Affected, but I don't know how to disable. Would
		you email back if you find out? Otherwise, I'd recommend switching
		your contract over to o2 or e-plus.</li>
		<li>o2 Germany and e-plus: Not affected, currently.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
