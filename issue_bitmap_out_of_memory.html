<p><strong>Öffi has just crashed with
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget</strong></p>
<p>After hours of investigation, I am pretty much convinced that
this is a serious memory handling problem of all Android versions to
date.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see this fixed, you should vote (star icon) for
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=8488">this
bugreport</a>. Even if it has been closed without resolution, your vote
works towards the problem to be taken seriously by Google.</p>
<p>There is also a discussion <a
	href="http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/aaaef75b6d3a0d8e/04fb2003941ca0d7">here</a>.</p>
