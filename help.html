<p>If you are an <strong>Android/Java Developer</strong>, you can
develop a plugin to support your favorite transportation network. Just
tell me and have a look at
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/public-transport-enabler/">the necessary
interface</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a <strong>public transport association</strong>, you
can provide a REST API for routing and live departure times. This can be
used by Öffi (and other projects). Please tell me and I'll provide you
with a proposal.</p>
<p>If you happen to own an old <strong>Android 1.5/1.6
device</strong> that you don't use any more: I'm in need of a testing device for
those old SDKs. Of course I'll send it back at any time in case you need
it.</p>
<p>I've received some questions of how to donate money. It's
perfectly ok to use Öffi for free, but you can donate for Öffi by
clicking here:
