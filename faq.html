	<dt>I keep posting comments to the Android market, but I don't get
	any reply.</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This is because Google does not allow replies to market
	comments. <strike>I cannot even post comments myself, as the publisher.</strike></p>
	<p>If you have a suggestion, a question or some other form of
	feedback that asks for a reply, consider <a
		href="mailto:oeffi@schildbach.de">e-mailing me</a>. Better yet, read
	through this FAQ first. Some frequent issues are already covered here.</p>
	<p>You are still invited to post market comments (and ratings).
	However, consider this as a way to just tell your opinion to other
	(potential) users.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>I'd like to see support for City X or Country Y.</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Please have a look a the <a href="oepnv_status.html">ÖPNV
	Status List</a>.</p>
	<p>In many cases, there needs to be at least basic support by the
	corresponding ÖPNV association/company. If you happen to know a contact
	person, would you <a href="mailto:oeffi@schildbach.de">let me know</a>?</p>

	<dt>Öffi has got two launcher icons. Why is this?</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Öffi consists of three mostly independant parts:
	<ul>
		<li>Stations: Which stations are nearby and will I catch the
		bus/train?
		<li>Directions: How do I get from A to B?
		<li>Plans: I want to navigate myself.
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Some of you regularly use Stations and some of you normally use
	Directions. I received some complaints that you always had to go
	through Stations in order to get to Directions. And, to be honest, this
	is not healthy for the phones resources as well. Thus, I introduced
	icons to directly launch into the most used parts.</p>
	<p>You don't have to <i>use</i> all icons though. It is still
	possible to go though one of the other application parts if you like
	to, by using the options menu.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>But I don't like my desktop cluttered with multiple icons.</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Note that you only need to put the needed/wanted icon(s) on your
	desktop. Leave the other icons alone and never see them again. If you
	prefer to directly launch application parts without having multiple
	icons on your desktop, put them into a folder! If you need to switch to
	another application part only now and then, feel free to use the
	options menu.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>
	<p>Öffi sometimes crashes with java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: bitmap
	size exceeds VM budget</p>
	</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>After hours of investigation, I am pretty much convinced that
	this is a serious memory handling problem of all Android versions to
	date.</p>
	<p>If you'd like to see this fixed, you should vote (star icon) for
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=8488">this
	bugreport</a>. Even if it has been closed without resolution, your vote
	works towards the problem to be taken seriously by Google.</p>
	<p>There is also a discussion <a
		href="http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/aaaef75b6d3a0d8e/04fb2003941ca0d7">here</a>.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Using my mobile data connection, I often get errors or 'no
	information available'. Using WLAN, everything works fine. What's going
	on?</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Most likely, this is due to your network provider not conforming
	to net neutrality. In order to save bandwidth, some providers drop
	information from the conversation they consider unneeded. They also add
	other information they think at least wouldn't harm. Both of these are
	false assumptions. The forums are full of problem descriptions that can
	be attributed to this behaviour.</p>
	<p>However, this issue should be worked around in all recent versions of Öffi.
	If you still have problems, try the following workarounds:</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>T-Mobile Germany: Their 'feature' is called Speed Manager and
		can be disabled via a <a href="http://speedmanager.t-mobile.de/">web
		interface</a>. I strongly advise you to do so, as this issue affects other
		applications as well.</li>
		<li>Vodafone D2: You can disable their 'feature' using
		<a href="http://performance.vodafone.de/">performance.vodafone.de</a>.
		Again, I strongly advise you to do so. Thanks to Dominik H. for the hint.</li>
		<li>o2 Germany and e-plus: Not affected, currently.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<br />
	</dd>

	<dt>I'd like to have a 'Take me home!' button</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>For this to work, you would need to configure your home address
	first.</p>
	<p>I don't like the idea of each travel-related app providing its
	own home address configuration dialog. Until Android adds a system-wide
	solution, I recommend adding yourself as a contact in your Google
	address book. You can access this from Öffi by opening the Contact
	Chooser.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>Öffi is using a lot of memory. Can you support external storage (SD card etc.)?</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>I know. The trouble is, Öffi's station databases can't be put on external storage
	for several technical reasons.</p>
	<p>However, you can tame Öffi's memory usage by using the new transportation
	network dialog (Option menu &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Transportation network). For
	example, if you don't need "Germany/Europe" just free up 12 MB by <em>long</em>
	pressing the appropriate entry.</p>
	<p>You can delete downloaded network plans the same way in the plans dialog (Option
	menu &rarr; Network plans); however Android will delete them automatically if memory
	runs short.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>What about the Froyo "App2Sd" feature?</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Unfortunately, the Froyo "App2Sd" feature is designed in a way so only the
	application itself can be moved to SD. Dynamic data cannot. Thus, of the several MB
	Öffi can allocate only about half a meg can be moved to SD. This is not worth the effort.</p>
	</dd>
	
	<dt>I'm tired of all these update notifications. Can you bundle updates
	into several larger ones?</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Unfortunately, in many cases there is no way around releasing an update
	as fast as possible. Often, one of the data providers web sites change, and
	the related network stops working for all Öffi users.</p>
	<p>If you are using Froyo (Android 2.2) user, you can check "Allow automatic
	updating" on <a href="market://details?id=de.schildbach.oeffi">Öffi's page</a>
	in Android market. You'll never be bothered by an update again!</p>
