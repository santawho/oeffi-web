<p>If you are an <strong>Android/Java Developer</strong>, you can
develop a plugin to support your favorite transportation network. Just
tell me and have a look at
<a href="https://github.com/schildbach/public-transport-enabler">the necessary
interface</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a <strong>public transport association</strong>, you
can provide a REST API for routing and live departure times. This can be
used by Öffi (and other projects). Please tell me and I'll provide you
with a proposal.</p>

<p>I've received some questions of <a href="gift.html">how to donate</a> money. It's
perfectly ok to use Öffi for free.</p>
